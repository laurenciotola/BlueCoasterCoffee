    <p>A coffee's environment, the way it is processed, how it is roasted, and brewed can all affect the way these tastes and aromas present themselves because they affect the chemistry of the coffee beans. So when we're tasting notes of “blueberry” in a coffee, we're experiencing either the same or very similar compounds that are in actual blueberries.</p>

    <p>In an effort to catalog and organize the flavors often found in coffee, the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) and World Coffee Research created the Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel. While it may at first look intimidating, the SCA flavor wheel is a helpful tool to guide you as you start trying to identify flavor notes in coffee. Start at the center with the most general descriptors like “nutty” and move outward to more specific options like “almond.” Think of the flavor wheel like a map, the coffee is your starting point, and the roaster's tasting notes as your possible destination. Can the wheel help you get from point A to point B? It will take some practice and you'll need to build a coffee tasting vocabulary, but over time you will be able to better identify what you're tasting in your cup.</p>

    <h1> what do tasting notes tell us about a coffee? </h1>

    <p> Because tasting notes are descriptions about the aroma, taste, flavor, and character of a coffee, once you know which tasting notes you enjoy you'll be able to find new coffees you'll love.</p>

    <p>Tasting notes of citrus, fruit, and floral (lime, tangerine, orange blossom, jasmine, raspberry) usually describe coffees that are roasted lighter to highlight the pleasant acidity of a coffee. We describe the character of these coffees as light, bright, lively, vibrant, juicy, or complex. We will go into deeper detail on the nuance of acidity later in the series.</p>

    <p>Tasting notes of chocolate, caramelized sugars, and roasty (dark chocolate, caramel, toasted almonds, roasty, smoky, tobacco, malt, baking spices, molasses) usually describe coffees that are roasted darker (roasted for longer at higher temperatures) to soften or mute acidity and accentuate body, balance, and richness. We describe these coffees as more traditional, classic, or approachable. These coffees are often described as balanced, full-bodied, rich, or bold. </p>
