        <p>Roasters are the people who transform imported green coffee beans into beans that can then be ground, brewed and consumed by customers — a vital part of the coffee supply chain.  At Blue Coaster Coffee, we take pride in completing this process under our own roof. Every cup of coffee is ours, roasted by roasters who know how to make a great cup of coffee. Their skill of being able to roast coffee to certain profiles that preserve the rich flavour of the beans is a very rare skill. It often takes years (and plenty of training) for an individual to become a master roaster. This is why we only hire the best, and you can count on each cup of coffee. Carter, our roaster is well versed in the world of tasting and grading and has previously worked as a coffee taster/cupper as well as a production manager, and roasting technician.</p>

        <p>All coffee beans need to be roasted before they can be consumed. After green beans have been imported and we finally apply the level of heat needed to trigger the various chemical reactions that cause beans to change colour, it's only then that all the beautiful flavours are made available to us. During the coffee roasting process, beans are heated to varying degrees and over specific durations, moving from a light brown colour to medium brown, and eventually to dark brown and then black. This is often compared to the process of toasting a slice of bread. The different roasts you'll see on coffee bags (light, medium, dark, etc.) refer to the point at which the roasting process is stopped. A general rule of thumb is the longer you roast, the more you move away from the natural flavours of the original bean — influencing the final flavour, aroma, and body of your finished cup.</p>
